I am currently in my first year of pursuing a PhD at [Imagine Institute](https://imagine-lab.enpc.fr/) from École des Ponts ParisTech (ENPC), [Lastig laboratory](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/) at National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (IGN), and [Cesbio laboratory](https://www.cesbio.cnrs.fr/) at French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) under the supervision of [Loic Landrieu](https://loiclandrieu.com/), [Nicolas Gonthier](https://ngonthier.github.io/), and [Clement Mallet](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/clement-mallet/). My PhD topic is **Self-supervised Cross-modal Geospatial Learning**. This interdisciplinary field combines machine learning, computer vision, and geospatial data analysis to develop innovative methods for understanding and extracting valuable insights from multimodal geospatial datasets.
